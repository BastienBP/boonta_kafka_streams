## What I contributed so far

The very first version of boontadata which, in terms of code, includes: 
- initial documentation
- ingestion in Python, which writes to Kafka and Cassandra
- consumption in Spark streaming (Python) which writes results in Cassandra (work in progress)

## What I may contribute later on

- Execution on multi host Azure Container Services clusters
    - cf <http://blog.3-4.fr/2016/08/30/deploying_containers_to_one_or_several_VMs/> for the general idea on how to move from one host to several hosts

## Why I contribute

I know Azure. 
I think it is a good host for this environment.
I like Big Data & Machine Learning.
It is a good opportunity to interact with people in the community and have a deeper knowledge on a number of Big Data & ML technologies.
